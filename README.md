## Alien Archaeologist

/spawnitem fossildisplay1
```
```
/spawnitem penguinfossil
```

Place the fossil display. Then interact with it and there is a spot to insert the fossil.

## Home Sweet Home

Go to any barren planet you want.

Fuel for your ship to move:
```
/spawnitem liquidfuel 1000
```

Build some homes on the barren planet. First, get materials.

```
/spawnitem colonydeed 1000
```
```
/spawnitem darkwoodmaterial 1000
```
```
/spawnitem torch 1000
```
```
/spawnitem woodendoor 1000
```

Build a box, place a light and door in it and then a colony deed as last. A new colonist should spawn.

## Cramped Colony

Build the houses like this:

## All Walks of Life

Keep going but make the rooms a bit bigger. Place the following items in a room, then the colony deed last.

```
/spawnitem spookybed
```
```
/spawnitem drillconsole
```
```
/spawnitem shadowshrine3
```
```
/spawnitem sewerwallgrate
```
```
/spawnitem retroscifibed
```
```
/spawnitem astrocrate
```
```
/spawnitem saloonsign
```
```
/spawnitem bunkerdisplay2
```
```
/spawnitem cabinbunkbed
```
```
/spawnitem stationmedscanner
```

## From the Ashes

Expand the cramped colony with two floors and 5 rooms on each level for a total of 10 tenants.

## A Helping Hand

Complete 10 quests from the colonists created during "All Walks of Life". Quests that require items can be spawned using `/spawnitem ...`. Full item list here: https://commands.gg/starbound/items

A note on avoiding certain quest types:
> I found after I did 25-30 quests or so, I just started declining certain quest types, as there are much shorter and faster sidequests your tenants can give you. The fastest seem to be the ones where they ask you to talk to another tenant, and you'll go back and forth between the two a couple times, until they either just ask you to bring something to the other, or place a piece of furniture down in their rooms. Or if you've already got a good farm going, the ones where they will give you certain seeds, and ask you to grow crops for them, you may already have them grown. Then you'll use those same crops to craft a certain food item. I personally never took any of their sidequests where they ask you to build a certain room type for a certain tenant, as I always wanted full control of what rooms I built.

## A Cheeky Chore

Do 25 quests from colonists, as above.

## A Tireless Task

Do 50 quests from colonists, as above.

## First Mate

```
/spawnnpc penguin crewmemberpenguin
```

You have to highlight the NPC crewmate and press E. Then a panel will come up asking to hire them. After that the achirvement will pop.

## A Motley Crew

```
/spawnitem upgrademodule 100
```
```
/spawnnpc apex crewmember
```
```
/spawnnpc floran crewmember
```
```
/spawnnpc glitch crewmember
```
```
/spawnnpc avian crewmember
```
```
/spawnnpc hylotl crewmember
```
```
/spawnnpc human crewmember
```
```
/spawnnpc novakid crewmember
```
When prompted to upgrade your ship:
```
/upgradeship '{"shipLevel":8}'
```

## Captain of the Year

After "A Motley Crew" is complete, run this command 5 times

```
/spawnnpc apex crewmember
```

## Feathered Friend

```
/spawnnpc penguin crewmemberpenguin
```

Already done on "First Mate" - does this pop both?

## Sweet Revenge

Do this 100 times

```
/spawnmonster smallflying 0
```

Then kill them with the laser launcher.

## Too Heavy to Kick

```
/spawnmonster robotchicken 1 '{"capturable":true}'
```

Kill the chicken with the laser launcher.

## Not in Front of the Children!

```
/spawnmonster motherpoptop
```

Kill it.

## Villain

```
/spawnnpc hylotl frogvillager
```

Kill it.
