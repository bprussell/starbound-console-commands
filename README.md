## Alien Archaeologist

```
/spawnitem fossildisplay1
```
```
/spawnitem penguinfossil
```

Place the fossil display. Then interact with it and there is a spot to insert the fossil.

## Home Sweet Home

Go to any barren planet you want.

Fuel for your ship to move:
```
/spawnitem liquidfuel 1000
```

Build some homes on the barren planet. [Here](https://starbounder.org/Stars) is a place where you can find such a planet.

First, get materials.

```
/spawnitem colonydeed 1000
```
```
/spawnitem darkwoodmaterial 1000
```
```
/spawnitem torch 1000
```
```
/spawnitem woodendoor 1000
```

Build a box, place a light and door in it and then a colony deed as last. A new colonist should spawn.

Note: to place the deed, the room has to have a background wall to place it on. You place the foreground walls with RT and the background walls with LT. The deed should be placed near the ground.(touching it?)

## Cramped Colony

Build the houses like this:

![Cramped Colony](https://i.imgur.com/r7fzzbv.png)

## All Walks of Life

Keep going but make the rooms a bit bigger. Place the following items in a room, then the colony deed last.

```
/spawnitem spookybed
```
```
/spawnitem drillconsole
```
```
/spawnitem shadowshrine3
```
```
/spawnitem sewerwallgrate
```
```
/spawnitem retroscifibed
```
```
/spawnitem astrocrate
```
```
/spawnitem saloonsign
```
```
/spawnitem bunkerdisplay2
```
```
/spawnitem cabinbunkbed
```
```
/spawnitem stationmedscanner
```

The achievement popped early for me. I didn't have to build the `stationmedscanner`. When it popped, my colony looked like this:

<img width="3840" height="2160" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23325352-5e3b-42cf-9284-fa39736be055" />


## From the Ashes

Expand the cramped colony with two floors and 5 rooms on each level for a total of 10 tenants.

This came naturally for me when I was working on "All Walks of Life".

## A Helping Hand

Complete 10 quests from the colonists created during "All Walks of Life". Quests that require items can be spawned using `/spawnitem ...`.

Full item list here: https://commands.gg/starbound/items

When asking to build a specific room, I had a big room for this that I would remove the deed if it existed, place the items, and add the deed back. Then I would remove the items and the deed to get ready for the next one. I got the following requirements for specific rooms. There may be more, but you can google the tag name to search for on starbounder.

## A Cheeky Chore

Do 25 quests from colonists, as above.

## A Tireless Task

Do 50 quests from colonists, as above.

## First Mate

```
/spawnnpc penguin crewmemberpenguin
```

You have to highlight the NPC crewmate and press E. Then a panel will come up asking to hire them. Then teleport to your base. After that the achievement will pop.

## Feathered Friend

```
/spawnnpc penguin crewmemberpenguin
```

Already done on "First Mate" - it pops both.

## A Motley Crew

```
/spawnitem upgrademodule 100
```
```
/spawnnpc apex crewmember
```
```
/spawnnpc floran crewmember
```
```
/spawnnpc glitch crewmember
```
```
/spawnnpc avian crewmember
```
```
/spawnnpc hylotl crewmember
```
```
/spawnnpc human crewmember
```
```
/spawnnpc novakid crewmember
```
When prompted to upgrade your ship:
```
/upgradeship '{"shipLevel":8}'
```

After hiring all of the crew members, teleport to the ship to unlock the achievement.

## Captain of the Year

After "A Motley Crew" is complete, run this command 5 times

```
/spawnnpc apex crewmember
```

Then teleport to the ship to unlock the achievement.

## Sweet Revenge

This command spawns 100 small flying monsters.

```
/spawnmonster smallflying 0 100
```

Then kill them with the laser launcher.

If it doesn't track properly, try playing with the number on the end. For example, use 10 instead of 100.

## Too Heavy to Kick

```
/spawnmonster robotchicken 1
```

Kill the chicken with the laser launcher.

## Not in Front of the Children!

```
/spawnmonster motherpoptop
```

Kill it.

```

```

Kill it.

First we need a pokeball.

/spawnitem capturepod
```

Now the monster.
```
/spawnmonster motherpoptop
```

Use laser to get its health down, (about 33% health left worked for me)

Equip the pokeball and throw at monster.
